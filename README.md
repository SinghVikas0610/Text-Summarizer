Text Summarization using PEGASUS (google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail)

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements text summarization using Google's PEGASUS model (google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail). PEGASUS is a state-of-the-art NLP model optimized for abstractive text summarization, trained on large-scale datasets like CNN/DailyMail. The project utilizes Hugging Face Transformers for model deployment and inference.

ðŸš€ Features

Abstractive Summarization: Generates concise and meaningful summaries rather than simply extracting key sentences.

Pretrained Model: Uses google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail for high-quality text summarization.

GPU Acceleration: Supports CUDA for faster inference on compatible devices.

Easy-to-Use Interface: Simple script for summarizing any text input.

Add-on : We can further make an UI for this using Flask.
